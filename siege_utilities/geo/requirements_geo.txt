# Geo module requirements for siege_utilities
# Includes both geocoding and spatial data functionality

# Core spatial libraries (REQUIRED for Census utilities)
geopandas>=0.12.0
shapely>=1.8.0
pyproj>=3.3.0
fiona>=1.8.0

# Data processing (REQUIRED)
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# HTTP requests (REQUIRED for Census utilities)
requests>=2.28.0

# HTML parsing (REQUIRED for Census utilities)
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
lxml>=4.9.0

# YAML configuration (REQUIRED)
pyyaml>=6.0

# Geocoding (existing functionality)
geopy>=2.3.0

# Database connectors (OPTIONAL - for advanced features)
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.0  # PostgreSQL/PostGIS
sqlalchemy>=1.4.0        # Optional - for database abstractions

# Optional: DuckDB for enhanced performance on large datasets
# duckdb>=0.7.0          # Uncomment if you want DuckDB support

# Optional: Additional spatial libraries
# folium>=0.12.0  # For interactive maps
# contextily>=1.2.0  # For basemaps
# rasterio>=1.3.0  # For raster data
# rioxarray>=0.11.0  # For raster data with xarray

# Note: DuckDB is optional and provides enhanced performance for:
# - Large analytical queries (10-100x faster than pandas on big datasets)
# - Complex SQL operations on spatial data
# - In-memory analytics without database setup
# 
# The enhanced Census utilities work perfectly with just the core
# geospatial stack (GeoPandas, Shapely, PyProj, Fiona).
# 
# Install DuckDB only if you need the performance boost:
# pip install duckdb
