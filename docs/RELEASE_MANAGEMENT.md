# Release Management System

## Overview

The Siege Utilities Release Management System provides automated, consistent releases across GitHub and PyPI. It ensures version consistency, automates the release process, and maintains proper documentation.

## Features

### üîÑ **Version Consistency**
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Ensures GitHub releases and PyPI packages have matching versions
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies version mismatches across platforms
- **Semantic Versioning**: Supports major, minor, and patch version bumps

### üöÄ **Automated Release Process**
- **Full Automation**: Complete release pipeline from version bump to deployment
- **Test Integration**: Runs test suite before release
- **Documentation Updates**: Automatically updates CHANGELOG.md
- **Git Operations**: Handles commits, tags, and pushes

### üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Operations**
- **Individual Steps**: Run specific parts of the release process
- **Skip Options**: Bypass tests or PyPI upload when needed
- **Manual Override**: Force releases regardless of interval

## Quick Start

### 1. **Check Current Status**
```bash
# Check version consistency across platforms
./scripts/release.sh check

# Or use Python directly
python scripts/release_manager.py --check
```

### 2. **Bump Version**
```bash
# Bump minor version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
./scripts/release.sh bump minor

# Bump patch version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
./scripts/release.sh bump patch

# Bump major version (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh bump major
```

### 3. **Build Package**
```bash
# Build Python package (source and wheel)
./scripts/release.sh build
```

### 4. **Upload to PyPI**
```bash
# Upload built package to PyPI
./scripts/release.sh upload-pypi
```

### 5. **Full Release**
```bash
# Complete release process
./scripts/release.sh release minor "New features and improvements"
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# GitHub API token for creating releases
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"

# PyPI API token for uploading packages
export PYPI_TOKEN="pypi_your_token_here"
```

### Token Setup

#### GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy token and set environment variable

#### PyPI Token
1. Go to PyPI Account Settings ‚Üí API tokens
2. Create new token with upload permissions
3. Copy token and set environment variable

## Detailed Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Check Commands
```bash
# Check version consistency
./scripts/release.sh check

# Show current configuration
python scripts/release_manager.py --config
```

#### Version Management
```bash
# Bump version in setup.py
./scripts/release.sh bump [major|minor|patch]

# Check current version
python scripts/release_manager.py --check
```

#### Package Operations
```bash
# Build package only
./scripts/release.sh build

# Upload to PyPI only
./scripts/release.sh upload-pypi
```

#### Full Release
```bash
# Complete release with notes
./scripts/release.sh release [type] "Release notes"

# Examples:
./scripts/release.sh release patch "Bug fixes and improvements"
./scripts/release.sh release minor "New features added"
./scripts/release.sh release major "Breaking changes and major updates"
```

### Python API

```python
from scripts.release_manager import ReleaseManager

# Initialize manager
manager = ReleaseManager()

# Check versions
status = manager.check_version_consistency()
print(f"Versions consistent: {status['consistent']}")

# Bump version
new_version = manager.bump_version("minor")
print(f"New version: {new_version}")

# Build package
success = manager.build_package()

# Create release
success = manager.full_release(
    "minor",
    "New features and improvements"
)
```

## Release Process Flow

### 1. **Pre-Release Checks**
- Verify version consistency across platforms
- Run test suite (unless skipped)
- Check environment variables

### 2. **Version Management**
- Bump version according to semantic versioning
- Update setup.py with new version
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

### 3. **Package Building**
- Clean previous builds
- Build source distribution (sdist)
- Build wheel distribution (bdist_wheel)

### 4. **Distribution**
- Upload to PyPI (unless skipped)
- Create GitHub release with notes
- Commit changes and create git tag

### 5. **Finalization**
- Push changes to remote repository
- Push tags to remote repository
- Update sync logs and configuration

## Configuration

### Wiki Sync Configuration
```json
{
  "last_sync": "2024-08-16T14:30:00",
  "sync_interval_hours": 24,
  "auto_commit": true,
  "auto_push": false,
  "backup_enabled": true,
  "excluded_files": [".git", ".gitignore", "*.tmp"],
  "included_directories": ["Recipes", "Architecture", "Examples"]
}
```

### Release Configuration
The release manager uses environment variables and project structure:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For GitHub API access
- `PYPI_TOKEN`: For PyPI uploads
- `setup.py`: For version information
- `CHANGELOG.md`: For release history

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Automated Wiki Updates
```yaml
name: Update Wiki
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'wiki_fresh/**'
      - 'scripts/update_wiki.py'
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force_update:
        description: 'Force update regardless of interval'
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean

jobs:
  update-wiki:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Update Wiki
      run: python scripts/update_wiki.py --force --auto-push
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Automated Releases
```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Build and Release
      run: |
        python scripts/release_manager.py --release \
          --bump-type patch \
          --release-notes "Automated release"
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        PYPI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Version Management**
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Bump major version for breaking changes
- Bump minor version for new features
- Bump patch version for bug fixes

### 2. **Release Notes**
- Write clear, descriptive release notes
- Include breaking changes prominently
- List new features and improvements
- Mention bug fixes and security updates

### 3. **Testing**
- Always run tests before release
- Use `--skip-tests` only for emergency releases
- Verify functionality in staging environment

### 4. **Documentation**
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each release
- Keep release notes in sync with code changes
- Document breaking changes clearly

### 5. **Security**
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate tokens regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Version Mismatch
```bash
# Check current versions
./scripts/release.sh check

# Manually sync versions if needed
./scripts/release.sh bump patch
```

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean previous builds
python setup.py clean --all

# Check dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Try building again
./scripts/release.sh build
```

#### Upload Failures
```bash
# Verify PyPI token
echo $PYPI_TOKEN

# Check package format
python -m twine check dist/*

# Try upload again
./scripts/release.sh upload-pypi
```

#### Git Issues
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Verify remote configuration
git remote -v

# Check authentication
git push origin main --dry-run
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export PYTHONPATH=.
python -c "
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
from scripts.release_manager import ReleaseManager
manager = ReleaseManager()
manager.check_version_consistency()
"
```
