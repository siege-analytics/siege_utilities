# Enhanced Census utilities - Essential dependencies
# These are the core requirements for the dynamic Census discovery system

# HTTP requests and HTML parsing (REQUIRED for Census discovery)
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
lxml>=4.9.0

# Core geospatial stack (REQUIRED for spatial data processing)
geopandas>=0.12.0
shapely>=1.8.0
pyproj>=3.3.0
fiona>=1.8.0

# Data processing (REQUIRED)
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Configuration (REQUIRED)
pyyaml>=6.0

# Note: DuckDB is NOT required for the enhanced Census utilities.
# The system works with the standard geospatial stack (GeoPandas, 
# Shapely, PyProj, Fiona) which is more than sufficient for most
# spatial data operations. DuckDB is only needed if you want to use
# the optional spatial_transformations module for DuckDB format conversion.
