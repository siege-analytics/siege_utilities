## 🆕 **Latest Major Update: Census Data Intelligence System**

### **🧠 Revolutionary Census Data Understanding**
- ✅ **Intelligent Dataset Selection**: Automatically recommends the best Census datasets based on your analysis type, geography level, and time requirements
- ✅ **Relationship Mapping**: Maps relationships between different Census surveys (Decennial, ACS 1-year/5-year, Economic Census, Population Estimates)
- ✅ **Quality Guidance**: Provides methodology notes, quality checks, and reporting considerations
- ✅ **Pitfall Prevention**: Helps avoid common mistakes like using incompatible datasets or ignoring margins of error
- ✅ **Human-Readable**: Transforms complex Census data selection into simple, intelligent recommendations

**Example Usage**:
```python
from siege_utilities.geo import select_census_datasets

# Get recommendations for demographic analysis at tract level
recommendations = select_census_datasets(
    analysis_type="demographics",
    geography_level="tract",
    variables=["population", "income", "education"]
)

# System automatically recommends ACS 5-Year Estimates (2020)
# because it provides stable, detailed data at tract level
primary_dataset = recommendations["primary_recommendation"]["dataset"]
print(f"Use {primary_dataset} for your analysis")
```

### **Dataset Relationship Mapping**
- **Survey Type Understanding**: Maps relationships between Decennial, ACS, Economic Census, and Population Estimates
- **Quality Guidance**: Provides reliability levels (High, Medium, Low, Estimated) with explanations
- **Pitfall Prevention**: Helps avoid common mistakes like comparing incompatible datasets
- **Best Practices**: Built-in guidance for correct tabulation and visualization

### **Quick Start**
```python
from siege_utilities.geo import quick_census_selection

# Quick selection for business analysis
result = quick_census_selection("business", "county")
print(f"Use {result['recommendations']['primary_recommendation']['dataset']}")

# Get comprehensive analysis approach
from siege_utilities.geo import get_analysis_approach
approach = get_analysis_approach("demographics", "tract", "comprehensive")
print(f"Recommended Approach: {approach['recommended_approach']}")
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install siege-utilities[geo]
```

```python
import siege_utilities

# All 500+ functions are immediately available
siege_utilities.log_info("Package loaded successfully!")

# NEW: Census Data Intelligence
from siege_utilities.geo import select_census_datasets
recommendations = select_census_datasets("demographics", "tract")
print(f"Use {recommendations['primary_recommendation']['dataset']}")

# File operations
hash_value = siege_utilities.get_file_hash("myfile.txt")
siege_utilities.ensure_path_exists("data/processed")

# String utilities
clean_text = siege_utilities.remove_wrapping_quotes_and_trim('  "hello"  ')

# Distributed computing (if PySpark available)
try:
    config = siege_utilities.create_hdfs_config("/data")
    spark, data_path = siege_utilities.setup_distributed_environment()
except NameError:
    siege_utilities.log_warning("Distributed features not available")

# Package diagnostics
